    "# Load Validation Example \n",

    " \n",
    "### Purpose: \n",
    "An essential query to validate across databases monthly target payment amounts. This was done in both dev and production environments. Total magnitude of monthly payment was around $35M. \n",
    " \n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "* Parameters\n",
    "* Temp Table operations\n",
    "* Left Joins\n",
    "* Utilization of null values\n",
    "* Case statements\n",
    "* Sub-Queries \n",
    "* Unions \n",
    " \n",
    "### Walkthrough:\n",
    "I’ll keep the walkthrough brief in the interest of time, and this is the shorter script of my examples. I am the sole author of this script and wrote it from scratch. \n",
    "\n",
    "I’ll start with the inner-most query and work our way out. The inner-most subquery contains union-ed summations for each of the 8 types of payment amounts for the current process month. This is the core of the validation. \n",
    " \n",
    "An outer-query consisting of two case statements was needed to establish a consistent order the table results would be returned in and a variance between expected target parameters and the amounts currently in the database. I aliased the inner and outer query together simply as b. \n",
    "Expanding further out, a temp table was created to determine the presence of the payment table in the database for that month. Some months it was normal and expected to not have data in certain payment tables. The temp table had hard-coded table names so that when it was left joined to query b, any empty payment tables would clearly appear as null in the final output. \n",
    " \n",
    "In summary, this was a critical validation query I authored that utilized a variety of SQL concepts. "
