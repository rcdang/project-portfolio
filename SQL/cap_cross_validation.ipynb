    "# Capitation Cross Validation\n",
    "Security Note:  No PII, PHI, or Company identifiable information, and data structures have been masked. \n",
    " \n",
    "### Purpose: \n",
    "A quicker solution to cross-validate capitation payments and adjustments between tables. Previously, these tables were not linked because our production data flowed into them at different times and each table stored and outputted the data slightly. Described in a non-technical way, imagine if you were shopping for apples, but all the labels indicating which type of apple and the price tag had been separately randomized. This solved a painful problem for my associate director. It also built traceability to the general ledger and readiness for potential database migrations.  \n",

    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "* Parameters\n",
    "* Temp Table operations\n",
    "* Inner Joins\n",
    "* Case statements\n",
    "* Sub-Queries \n",
    "* Update statements\n",
    "* Window Functions \n",
    "* Unions\n",
    " \n",
    "### Walkthrough:\n",
    "1. Identify goal/mock up of expected results\n",
    "2. Data profiling; identify linkable, filterable, and final returned fields, this is also where I drafted how I could cast, parse, or use some other type of data transformation \n",
    "3. Subset Data into temp tables and/or subqueries, this is where I determined how tables would differentiate between main payment and adjustment values\n",
    "4. Select desired data from joined tables\n",
    "5. Test data\n"
